# Introduction to Tableau Public <img src="images/tableau_crosses.png" width="100"/>

Tableau, according to their [website](https://tableau.com), is "a visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problems—empowering people and organizations to make the most of their data." The company is focused on business analytics, but there are many applications for this software whose strength is building interactive webplatforms for visual data analytics.

There are different versions of the software, mainly Tableau Public and Tableau Desktop. The latter requires a license, but if you are a student or a teacher, you can get a free, renewable, 1-year license from the [Tableau Academic Programs page](https://www.tableau.com/community/academic). There is also a licensed product called Tableau Prep - a software for prepping data to be used by Tableau. ([OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a similar, license-free, data cleaning tool).

Tableau Public is available for everyone without status verification, but it has access to less data on the Tableau Server. Also, and IMPORTANTLY, all of the workbooks are publicly posted on the web. You can only save workbooks to your personal computer with Tableau Desktop. DO NOT create any workbooks with sensitive or private data in Tableau Public.



## Workshop Resources
 - Software - access here: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/)
 - Data - download from this repo's [data folder](https://github.com/frizatch/Tableau-Intro-to-TableauPublic/tree/main/data)

## Workshop Goals
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Load data into Tableau
- Assess how Tableau has classified your data
- Make various data visualizations, including maps
- Create an interactive dashboard that ties your visualizations together

## <a name="why-tableau"></a>  Why use Tableau?

Tableau's main purpose is to create a platform for visual data exploration. Here are some of its strengths:

- Easily create interactive dashboards
- Compatibility with a good range of data files
- Connections to web-based data
- Built-in "pop-ups" for ease of information access
- Drag and drop GUI


## <a name="glossary"></a>  A Tableau Glossary

Tableau uses some terms that you may not have seen before, or uses these terms differently from what you're used to, so here is a quick guide to clarify what you'll see:

**Measures**: *quantitative data*

**Dimensions**: *qualitative or categorical data*

**Marks**: *all the rows of your data. One mark equals one row.*

**Marks Box (card)**: *control sparce for adding further detail into your visualization.* 
•	Click on one of the properties in the box to manually change the way that your visualization appears. 
•	Drag and drop Dimensions or Measures onto properties in the Marks box to change the context or detail of that Dimension or Measure.

**Sheets**: *Where you create your data visualization. Each visualization will require its own sheet.*  

**Dashboard**: *The interactive display of multiple visualizations from the Sheets.*


## <a name="start"></a>  Getting Started

In order to get your Tableau Public connected to some data, you need a) Tableau Public and b) some data!

Under the Workshop Resources at the top, you'll find links to get both. You may be at a computer that already has Tableau Public so you're set on the software. If not, go to the [Tableau Public Page](https://public.tableau.com/s/), enter your email to sign up for an account and download the app. You should then be able to launch it from your machine. For the data, you'll find it in a data folder where you can click on each file to get a download link. For the first part of the workshop, you only need to download:

[IncomePopLand_US_2019.xls](https://github.com/frizatch/Tableau-Intro-to-TableauPublic/blob/main/data/IncomePopLand_US_2019.xlsx)

This data is a spreadsheet put together for this workshop about the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

The information is fairly random, but largely consists of:
- Population data for states and capital cities (ACS 2019 and census 2020)
- Land, water, and National Park Service areas for each state
- Median household income by race and age (ACS 2019)

We'll explore this data
